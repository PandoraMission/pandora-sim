THE PHOENIX MODELS BY FRANCE ALLARD AND COLLABORATORS

These models are for 
stars/brown dwarfs/planets (without irradiation), with a cloud model.
These use static, spherical symmetric, 1D simulations to completely 
describe the atmospheric emission spectrum. The models account for the 
formation of molecular bands, such as those of water vapor, methane, or
titanium dioxide, solving for the transfer equation over more than 20,000 
wavelength points on average -  producing synthetic spectra with 2 Angstrom 
resolution. The line selection is repeated at each iteration of the model 
until it has converged and the thermal structure obtained. The models here 
are calculated with a cloud model, valid across the entire parameter range.
